Simple arbitrary-size tic-tac-toe game.

To Build
--------

You will need a standards-compliant C compiler and GNU Make. On Debian
GNU/Linux and derivatives, you can install these with

    # apt-get install gcc make

After that, build with

    $ make

To Install
----------

If you want to install this program, just run

    # make install

Usage
-----

The board is labeled with coordinates of letters and numbers. When placing a
move, write the letter and then the number. For example, to put your mark in
the very first cell, type `a0` as your position.

Custom Boards
-------------

To change the size of the game board, you must define `BOARD_SIZE` at compile
time. When compiling, add `-DBOARD_SIZE=X` to the `CFLAGS` where `X` is the
desired size. For example, to set the board size to 6, run

    $ make CFLAGS=-DBOARD_SIZE=6
